# Lichesspecker
The "Woodpecker Method" is a chess study technique popularized by Axel Smith in his book *The Woodpecker Method*.
The method involves the repeated exposure to the same set of chess puzzles, using spaced-repetition, to help player's develop pattern recognition and tactical awareness.
In his book, he provides a set of approximately 1,000 chess puzzles which the user works through as a set in repeated cycles.
The first cycle takes several months to complete, but with each subsequent cycle the time to solve all the puzzles decreases.

**Lichesspecker** is my take on the Woodpecker method using the free and open source puzzle database provided by [lichess.org](https://database.lichess.org/).
Unlike the original Woodpecker Method, Lichesspecker is a set of sixty themed decks each containing around 1,000 chess puzzles from across the rating spectrum.
In total, the Lichesspecker collection contains just under 60,000 themed chess puzzles.
On Lichess.org, puzzle popularity ranges from -100 to 100. 
Puzzles included in this collection have a minimum popularity of 25.
Additionally, the puzzles were selected using systematic sampling, so puzzle difficulty ranges from the trivial to the master level.

**Anki** is spaced-repetition flashcard software which lends itself naturally to the Woodpecker Method. 
The Lichesspecker collection is shared an an Anki deck. 
The cards use TowelSniffer's excellent [Anki-Chess-2.0](https://github.com/TowelSniffer/Anki-Chess-2.0) card template.
